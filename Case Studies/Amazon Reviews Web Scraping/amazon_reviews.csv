Soumya Kumar,5.0,I was in doubt before investing such a huge amount for a phone but after I got it I was really amazed by how much apple is better than android.1. Camera is consistently good.2. Software support is far better than android.3. Design is superb also the fit and finish.4. Lag is extinct as per my use.5. Photo and video editing is a a smooth af6. Screen has very good colour representation7 . Form factors I.e. 6.1 inch size fits perfectly in hand and in also formal dress which is a peace of mind as we worry less about it falling down.The only problem I faced with pro model is that it tends to get little warm when editing high quality content like HDR or RAW images.After software updates the heating issue has gone drastically.Other than that I would say go for it if your budget is not a limit.Peace out.
Sriram Natarajan,5.0,"Using Apple iPhone after 10 years. Really product is good in quality, stability, and feels sturdy. Display is really good very bright. Battery is really superb for users from android. Very quick charging while using 35w Samsung original charger. No heat no lagging no hanging. I don‚Äôt play games so no idea about that. Handling is easy. Dynamic island is very useful. iOS software is really feels like half baked cookie. While you connect in Bluetooth earbuds and auto answering is in on it works perfect. But once you switch off Bluetooth auto answering still works so you need to switch off the Bluetooth and auto answering. While on call if you receive any messages your ear drum will get affected due to loud sound. 5g is good. Coming to packing Amazon does a worst job. The packing I received is really just a Amazon printed plastic cover. They send me a message while shipping your iPhone is packed safely and shipped. But while receiving the packing is really worst. But on time delivery."
Kundan,5.0,Great Phone. Great delivery by Amazon
AmazonCustomer,4.0,"The Good: The software is extremely smooth and stable. Battery life is good and not too exceptional. It‚Äôs certainly not as good as 13 Pro Max. The battery is currently lasting me 24 hours instead of 18 hours on my Android. I‚Äôd say the 3200mAh from Apple is comparable to a 5500mAh Android battery. The 48MP camera is sharp and fast. The dynamic island is extremely helpful in many situations that involve multitasking. I use it very frequently during calls. The screen is bright and looks very clear even in direct sunlight. Haptics are very unique and delightful. Face id is much easier than a fingerprint scanner. Gone are the days of wiping your fingers. The Safari password manager can save passwords for all sites and authenticate directly with Face Id. The size of the phone 6.1 inch is very comfortable for one hand use and one needn‚Äôt shuffle around the phone for one hand use like on 6.7 inch phones.Where Apple really shines is with the ecosystem. My 14 Pro, Series 8 watch and Airpods 3 integrate so seamlessly that it‚Äôs hard to find the same perfection in other ecosystems I have used in the past. The security of this device is top notch but is also a double edged sword. App usage isn‚Äôt very straightforward such as no access to the internal memory. But such limitations are there to enforce strong security. One simply cannot get the same data isolation and security as in iOS on Android. Highly personalized ads too don‚Äôt appear while using this phone which means privacy is preserved much better than on Android.The Bad: The phone is extremely heavy for it‚Äôs size, so with a case and protector it weighs around a quarter kilo. It still uses a lightning port so new accessories are needed. If you don‚Äôt have a basic skill for photo editing you might notice the photos from the phone are a bit dull and not directly postable, but nothing a small tweak can‚Äôt fix. Battery drains faster when using the camera outside so for vacations either consider a power bank or switch to a 14 Pro Max. AOD is beautiful but honestly it‚Äôs a bit distracting and you could save more battery by simply using tap to wake instead.The Rant : I‚Äôd also like to complain about either the Seller (Appario Retail) or Amazon for not giving value to pre-orders. I ordered my phone on 11th (iPhone 14 Pro was available by Apple on 9th Sept and stock of 128GB 14 Pro arrived to Amazon on 11th) and it wasn‚Äôt even dispatched till 17th thus defeating the purpose of pre-ordering. Pre-ordering from Apple ideally results in the product reaching your doorstep on 16th September instead of being dispatched on 16th September!"
Ashwas,5.0,"I am first time iphone user and for me there is no older iPhone to compare to. So my review is coming from a long time android user. I am writing this after using phone for 2 days. The purple color looks purple only under good light. Generally it looks like dark gray.Pros:1. Love the display, the pill cutout is disturbing initially, but you'll get used to after some time.2. Battery life seems great when using wifi for internet. I have dual sim, 1 physical and 1 esim and I found that battery drains more on mobile data. I don't know why.3. Software experience is great. Everything works smoothly, some of the banking apps I was using on my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus) used to feel choppy and there were frame drops in many apps. That could just be Samsung's fault with software. Anyway the same apps work perfectly and so smooth on iPhone.Cons:1. It is a heavy phone. I am coming from Note 10 which is much bigger phone but that wasn't very heavy. Even though this is smaller phone, it is heavier."

I upgraded from iPhone XR to iPhone 14 pro. They both are same size(6.1‚Äù) and comfortable to use. Some things to considerPros:1) Immersive display with ‚ÄòPro Motion. It‚Äôs the best.2) Dynamic island. It‚Äôs not just a punch hole it responds to touch and is customisable.3)A-16 is really really fast, you will love it.4) Camera is great and video quality at 4K 60fps is smooth af.5) Night photography is ü§©6) speakers are way louder for its size7) always on display is a highlight this yearCons:1) Battery life is pretty average2) Still lightning cable and not type -c3) very costly in India than US and other countries.4) Android counterparts offer equally compelling products(eg.Samsung, pixel, OnePlus, Huawei)"
Pritam Dasgupta,5.0,"An absolute beast of a device. Recommended for those apple lovers who are awestruck by the simplicity and ease of use of iPhones over the years. iPhones are meant to be upgraded after years of use and unlike android devices not every year because they don‚Äôt need to be.The phone is magic, the display, the camera, the battery backup everything is top notch.I bought it at a time when 15 pro is available but there is not much substantial difference between the two and plan on using it at least till iPhone 22 pro comes out."
Salil,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



It is still early to comment. But overall feel of the phone is great. It is a bit heavy, the camera lenses are huge compared to other phones. But iOS is smooth to use and no lag observed. Coming from android, few things to remember - WhatsApp backup can be done only through 3rd party application on PC as android saves the WhatsApp data in google drive and iPhone in iCloud. SMS can also be saved only through a third application, else you should simply back up from Android and forget it. We faced this issue as we had opted for a phone exchange and had to backup everything before erasing the data. If you are not opting for a phone exchange, you can check other apps like Move to iOS, which transfers data from android to iPhone, (only during the initial setup, not later)"
Lata,5.0,Just buy it bro !!
Sarkar,5.0,Iphone 14 pro its crazy üòç‚Ä¶
Supria barman,4.0,After researching about the dealer and reading most of the reviews I decided to buy that n I took this phone to Apple Store they says it‚Äôs original one so please guys u can buy this one while selling one of ur kidney ü•≤ but it took long time to be delivered n the packing can be improved
Rahul Saini,4.0,Genuine Apple Brand. No comment needed
Sunny M Leo,5.0,"This is exactly what you would expect from an iPhone. All the perks and all the cons - what you see is what you get. No surprises here.I wanted a top-notch camera in my pocket to take photos of my 4-year-old and so I am happy with this. Several things of course could have been better, but you wouldn't hear any complaints from me. I did enough research on what I am getting into and so no surprises and no disappointments."
Placeholder,4.0,Good phone..

Sumiit Patnaaik,5.0,"The delivery from Amazon was really good. I was worried if the packaging and phone will be in the correct shape and size. Just anxiety. But it went all well. Now the phone is superb, it's overheating.One thing to notice, eSIM with this phone is not working with AIRTEL. It seems their systems are not updated to cover iPhone14 Pro models so far. So if you get an eSIM issue, better get this checked from your carriers."
Prateek,5.0,"The iPhone 14 Pro is a game changer this is my 2nd iPhone purchase from amazon. The camera quality is incredible and the speed at which it operates is unmatched. The ProMotion technology makes scrolling and swiping feel smoother than ever. The battery life is also impressive and lasts me all day. Overall, I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a top-of-the-line device"

Goutham,5.0,"There is nothing to blame on performance point of view its just awesome and camera is great ,only con is that we have to sacrifice one of our kidney for it ‚Ä¶sarcastically speaking üòÇ‚Ä¶but worth it"
Krishna Murty Ryali,2.0,"Guys this is my worst decision to move ti ios. all that excitement turned into disappointment and nightmares  i bought with 1.4 lakhs. the move was worst in my life. the set up that is to move data from android to apple phone was never easy, it al turned my iphone 14 pro dead. and it would not respond no matter what i would do. i was without a contact number for more than a week as the phone wouldn't turn on. Android is much easier to use and handle.  I think you should attend apple ios course to manage this iphone. for anything i want to do there is no easyway to do simple things on iphone.  worst experienceIT charges only with magsafe wireless charger and not with any other charget baught even from apple company. If the battery is less than 25% iphone doesn't work and acts like a dead phone."

I tried everything then I reset the phone. But I was so disappointed. I was not expecting this from apple. Then I tried to call amazon customer care. They give me some crap about the deal between Amazon and Apple. That they can't exchange the phone.

AR,1.0,I had ordered Iphone 14 pro space black(128 gb) on 3rd Apr 23 and same was delivered on 4th Apr 23. But when I opened the phone and checked warranty period. It showed me limited warranty till 8 Feb 2024. Which means product which I got was 1st time logging on 8 Feb 2023. Thus product delivered to me was an used product.

Raj Kamal,1.0,Wastage of money. Phone heat up during normal usage.
Camera heating issue. Don't buy,1.0,While taking pics. HeatingAmazon worst return policy
Ravi Mittal,4.0,"I like the design, sturdiness and the smoothness of my 14 pro max. Battery life is good as well but it only last for a day even after less usage.This is the first time I am using an Apple product so wasn‚Äôt sure between pro and pro max. I‚Äôll recommend you guys to purchase pro since it‚Äôs lighter and handy. Pro max is too bulky to carry.Selfie camera of this phone is not too good as compared to competitors who are providing better camera in less price. Only back camera provides a good night pictures not its selfie camera.I love the dynamic island display and the overall smoothness of the phone. One thing I don‚Äôt like is overheating of my phone. It gets hot very easily and this makes me worry sometimes.Overall it‚Äôs a very nice phone."
Jay Patil,4.0,How are the sim slots in this variant :1) 2 Esims2) 2 Physical Sims3) 1 Esim & 1 Physical sim
Naresh,4.0,its a good phone with best performance. the cemara also good. value for money. you can play pubg for long hoursyou can do programmingyou can send a mail
Maahi,4.0,So I have recently shifted from 13 pro to 14 pro and I wanna share my review that don‚Äôt waste too much money on 14 because you can find same features except dynamic island on 13 everything is almost same and let‚Äôs just wait for 15 so that we can find out whether it is useful to shift on 15 or not !
SUDEEP KUMAR,3.0,Camera quality is not upto the mark .picture quality is low.the image is not so according price .it is pathetic after

Anny,3.0,"I have used Iphones and also other android phones.. I must say Nokia G60 is way way far better than this in terms of performance and camera, and also way more pocket friendly, if you are a mirror selfie person, go for iphone, if you want the real stuff, its Nokia.Well, its not a popular opinion, but an honest and tried and tested review.. Nokia is Nokia, Baap Baap hi hota h :)"
Krrish,4.0,"iPhone 14Pro is Blazing fast and does every task at ease ,but miserably fails in power management ,battery don‚Äôt even last a day with light usage .120hz refresh rate feels sluggish compared to android phones.Camera is good with low light still needs improvement .Dynamic island remains to be a pretty interactive way along with Always On display.Better go with 14 Pro max or go with 13Pro for better battery backup ."
Ayush Anbhore,4.0,"As an Indian consumer, I understand that the price of the iPhone 14 Pro 256 is quite high, and it may require significant financial investment. However, the device is a testament to the hard work and dedication that you have put in to achieve your goals. With its advanced features and capabilities, the iPhone 14 Pro 256 is a powerful tool that can help you stay connected, stay productive, and achieve even greater success in your personal and professional life.Overall, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is an excellent choice for anyone who is looking for a high-end smartphone with advanced features and capabilities. While the price may be steep, the device is worth the investment for those who value performance, quality, and innovation."
Mohan kumar,3.0,Phone is good but I lost one of my kidney. Waiting for 15 pro to sell my other kidney. !
FAROOQ KHAN,5.0,Camera quality wow..!!! You must buy if your budget allows. I bought these from else. Sab kuch sahi hi hain
Anas Khan,4.0,"I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro and I am already familiar with iOS as I had iPhone 6 before that. I bought 14 Pro solely for its camera. I am someone who does a lot of mobile photography. The rest of the features are good but I am going to talk about camera and battery life. Battery life is decent for a compact phone, it lasts almost a day depending on your usage. Moving to the cameras, I feel it lacks a bit there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs good enough if you‚Äôre someone who does casual photography but if you belong to the category of nitpickers, the images produced are contrasty which you might consider a good thing but the shadows are way too crush and the phone also lacks at night photography compared to the competition.Other than that, the overall smartphone is great but if you‚Äôre someone who prefers better battery life and bigger display, consider iPhone 14 Pro Max or simply wait for the 15 series."
