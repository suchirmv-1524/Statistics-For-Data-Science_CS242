Tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing : Calculate the percentage of null values for each column and eliminate columns containing over 20% null values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    1. Analyse the distribution of vehicle types in the dataset.
    2. Determine most common fuel type among listed vehicles.
    3. Calculate average horsepower of vehicles with most common fuel type.
    4. Explore the distribution of city_fuel_economy among various cities.

3. Advanced Analysis:
    1. Examine price trend over the years for the top 5 most popular body types and visualise it.
    2. Investigate relationship between back_legroom and price using correlation analysis and visualise it.
    
4. Regression Analysis:
Utilise regression to predict car prices based on relevant features in the dataset

Project Deliverables:
● A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing code to preprocess the data, perform analysis,and make predictions using Pandas and NumPy.
● Visualizations (e.g. bargraphs, lineplots) to illustrate the findings from theexploratory analysis.
● A trained regression model to predict car prices based on features in the dataset
